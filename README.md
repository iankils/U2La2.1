In this lesson, students will apply the JavaScript they've been reviewing and strengthening in the start of Unit 2 to the context of a webpage. This is an essential first step in delivering on the promise made in the title of this course - The Interactive Web.

As written, this lesson occurs entirely in JavaScript - the starting and ending HTML and CSS files are identical. This is intentional, to both focus students on one single file, and illustrate the potential JavaScript has to make a webpage come to life. However, if your students need support reviewing any of the earlier content, feel free to modify the starter code and add in some review questions or activities focused on the HTML and CSS files.

Objectives
Students will be able to:

Add 'click' event listeners to elements. Use control flow / conditionals to respond to specific user inputs.

Use string interpolation and the .innerHTML property to dynamically append elements to the DOM.

Explain why DOM Manipulation script tags must be included below the elements they will be manipulating, or include the defer attribute.

Store HTML elements in JS variables using document.querySelector().

Use named ES6 (arrow) functions as callback functions for event listeners.

Use console.log() and the developer console to debug code.

Do Now
What should happen when you press any of the three buttons currently shown on screen. Additionally, ask them to study the source code and identify each of the following:

What is the ID of the apple button?

What is the ID of the banana button?

What is the ID of the mango button?

What is the ID of the green box?

What is the ID of the part of the code where your total amount due will appear?

Extensions
Mild Activities

Add a fourth column and button in the HTML for a fourth button.

Style that button for the appropriate fruit in the CSS.

Add all the necessary JavaScript to make sure that button works as intended.

Medium Activities

Create a variable to keep track of each fruit on offer, and use it to keep track of how many of each fruit the user has added to their cart. Using that as a jumping off point, come up with a way to display a receipt that aggregates quantity instead of just listing them, i.e. "Apple x3" instead of "Apple Apple Apple".

Add a reset or "clear cart" button to the screen. When clicked, it should empty your cart and reset your total.

Spicy Activities

Find a way to add a small clickable "x" or other similar button next to each item in your shopping cart. When clicked, it should remove the item and update the total accordingly.
